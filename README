LD_PRELOAD/DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES hooking for postgresql to add a large delay to WAL synching

obviously don't use this with database that you are about because it will destroy the data

    pg_ctl init -D pg_data
    DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES=./target/debug/libwal_delayer.dylib postgres -D pg_data -c port=5433
